Predict the Output: Arrays
Practice using a T-diagram to go through the following code snippets and predict the output.  Once you're done run your code and see if your prediction was correct.  Create a .js file with the code snippets and your predicted output and upload it once you're done.

Predict 1: 

var arr = [8,6,7,5,3,0,9]
for(var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){    
    console.log(arr[i]);
}
Predict 2:

var arr = [7,3,8,4,2,0,1];
for(var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){ 
    if(arr[i] % 2 == 0){
        console.log(arr[i]);
    } 
    else{
        console.log("That is odd!");
    }
}
Predict 3:

var arr = [1,3,8,-5,0,-2,4,-1];
var newArr = [];
for(var i = 0; i< arr.length; i++){
    if(arr[i] < 0){
        newArr.push(arr[i]);
        arr[i] = arr[i] * -1;
    }
    else if(arr[i] == 0){
        arr[i] = "Zero";
    }
    else{
        arr[i] = arr[i] * -1;
    }
}
console.log(arr);
console.log(newArr);
